# Project Todos
The assignment was to make a ToDo-app in React Redux where I wrote my own reducers and actions. 

## The problem
The problem I had was the understanging of reducers, and how the structure works. I solved it with watchin lectures and discussing with my class-mates. I started with planning how I wanted the app to look like and then what components i would need. 
If I had more time, I woudld have wanted to sort the list, so that the tasks that where done would be at the bottom. Also make categories for different tasks. I would also have spent more time on the styling.
